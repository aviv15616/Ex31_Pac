If I were to create a PacMan algorithm from scratch, My initial thoughts would be:
1.create a function that would move Pac man on any Matrix(up, down, left, right).
2.create a function that recognizes ghosts, and decides on safe routes for PacMan.
3. create a function for shortest paths for him to be fast and efficient.
4.create a function that gives the map indexes in which pacman can go and cant go to map him.
